# MTA DayZ HeadShot Blood
When you hit the head shot on the player you play a Splash sound like Rust's HeadShot.
If the Player is Helmet, it plays a Metal sound and does not kill the player instantly but causes normal weapon damage.
I have not yet tested but in Theory and to work Any doubts or Bug please get in touch!
